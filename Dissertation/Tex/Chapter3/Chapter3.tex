\chapter{Developmentally regulated expression of collapsin response mediator protein 4 in the interlaminar zones of the lateral geniculate nucleus}
\textbf{Abstract}\\
\textbf{Eye-Specific inputs are separated from each other in the first processing stages of the mammalian visual system.Ê During development, retinal ganglion cell axons from the two eyes move from an initially overlapping state in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to one in which eye-specific projections are segregated into discrete LGN laminae, defined both anatomically and physiologically.Ê This process is dependent on both activity and molecular paradigms.Ê Here, we report the spatiotemporal distribution of a novel and developmentally regulated molecular marker for LGN lamination; collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) in normal ferrets.  To determine whether CRMP4 expression is a conserved feature of mammalian LGN development, we also explore CRMP4 in the mouse and macaque.  CRMP4 expression in all three species delineates cytoarchitectonicÊ boundaries in the developing LGN.  Our data implicate CRMP4 as a patterning force that operates at LGN laminar boundaries to fine tune and maintain the locations of eye-specific projections in the nucleus after basic relationships between the retina and LGN layers have been established.}

\section{Introduction}
In binocular mammals, the LGN receives information from both eyes but separates eye-specific inputs into anatomically and physiologically defined laminae.  In the adult ferret, retinal afferents originating in the contralateral and ipsilateral retina have major terminations in the A and A1 layers of the LGN, respectively.Ê Additionally, retinal ganglion cell terminations define the three retinorecipient C layers (Linden et al., 1981a; Cucchiaro and Guillery, 1984).Ê Each of these laminae is bounded by cell sparse interlaminar zones.Ê All of these structures develop postnatally in the ferret.Ê At first, cytoarchitectonic laminae and interlaminar zones are not distinguishable and retinal projections from both eyes are intermingled (Linden et al., 1981b; Shatz, 1983; Sretavan and Shatz, 1986b).Ê Over the first ten days of postnatal development, segregation of retinal afferents into eye-specific projections is largely completed, followed by separation of laminae with cell sparse zones within the next week, and adult morphology by the fourth postnatal week (Linden et al., 1981a; Huberman et al., 2002).  The mature A and A1 laminae are further divided into ON and OFF sub-laminar zones.  At these ON/OFF boundaries, there are minor cell sparse zones (Stryker and Zahs, 1983). 

The refinement of eye-specific inputs and the development of cytoarchitectural laminae in the LGN occur in a developmental epoch characterized by both patterned neural activity and patterned gene expression.  Although patterns of neuronal activity are known to be essential for instructing the maturation of the LGN (Sretavan and Shatz, 1986b), less in known about the contribution of molecular paradigms to LGN development.  To date, the best example of a molecular paradigm at work in LGN patterning is that of the Eph receptor family of molecules and their ligands, the ephrins.  The Ephrin family is known for its role in retinotopy development in the LGN (Pfeiffenberger et al., 2006) but these molecules also influence eye-specific segregation after the initial period of retinal afferent overlap in the LGN (Drescher et al., 1995; Flanagan and Vanderhaeghen, 1998; Huberman et al., 2005; Pfeiffenberger et al., 2005). 

Here, we report the spatiotemporal distribution of collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4, also known as dihydropyrimidinase-like 3/DPYSL3), a novel and developmentally regulated molecular marker for LGN lamination, in normal ferrets as well as in the normal mouse and macaque.Ê CRMP family members have been implicated in growth cone dynamics and guidance and are differentially expressed across the central nervous system (Wang and Strittmatter, 1996).Ê CRMP2, CRMP4, and CRMP5 show developmentally regulated expression profiles in cat primary visual cortex, indicating a possible role for the CRMP family in visual system patterning (Cnops et al., 2004; Cnops et al., 2006; Van den Bergh et al., 2006a).Ê Consistent with a putative role in neural patterning, juvenile CRMP4 expression is high and adult expression is low (Cnops et al., 2004; Cnops et al., 2006; Van den Bergh et al., 2006a).Ê We hypothesize that spatially confined expression of CRMP4 in the normally developing LGN may act to fine tune retinal axon locations after their initial positioning by early activity dependent and molecular paradigms.

\section{Materials and methods}
\subsection{Ferret and mouse tissue preparation}
All ferret and mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Carnegie Mellon University institutional animal care and use committee.Ê Eighteen (9 normal, 5 monocular enucleate, 4 binocular enucleate) black sable ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) between the ages of postnatal day 2 (P2) and adulthood were sacrificed and perfused for histology.  Ferrets were sacrificed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (250mg/kg) then perfused transcardially with 0.9\% NaCl, 4\% paraformaldehyde, and 4\% parafomaldehyde with 30\% sucrose, all  in .1M phosphate buffer.Ê Tissue was post-fixed for a minimum of 24 hours before sectioning.  Horizontal LGN sections were made from one LGN per animal at 50$\mu$m using a freezing microtome.Ê Mice were perfused in the same manner.Ê Mouse brains were sectioned at 50$\mu$m in the coronal plane.

\subsection{Macaque tissue preparation}
All procedures were performed according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and in strict compliance with institutional protocols of the California Regional Primate Center at the University of California, Davis.  A timed-pregnant macaque was prepared for surgery under ketamine (10 mg/kg), and anesthesia was induced with 1.3\% isoflurane. The fetus was delivered by cesarean section and killed by swift decapitation.  The brain was  removed from the skull and fixed in freshly prepared 4\% paraformaldehyde in  0.1M phosphate buffered saline for 5 days then stored at 40ûC in phosphate buffered saline.

\subsection{Immunohistochemistry}
CRMP4 LGN expression was characterized by immunohistochemical stains with a primary antibody against CRMP4 (1:500 dilution, cat. AB5454, Millipore, Billerica, MA) followed by a fluorescent secondary antibody (Alexa 594, 1:500 dilution, cat. A-11012, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).Ê The polyclonal primary antibody was raised against a synthetic sequence (YDGPVFDLTTTPK) corresponding to amino acids 499-511 of human CRMP4a and amino acids 612-624 human CRMP4b.  In the human, mouse, monkey, rat, and cat, the antibody is reported to react with two isoforms of CRMP4 running at 64kDa and 74kDa.  The same protocol was used to visualize CRMP4 expression in mouse and macaque LGNs. This protocol was used to visualize CRMP4 in the retina of P14 and P40 ferrets in egg-yoke embedded horizontal sections made at 50µm. Specificity of the CRMP4 primary antibody in ferret LGN tissue was tested using western blot.Ê A single band at 62kDa was observed in the western blot demonstrating that the antibody reacts specifically with a protein of a similar mass to that of rat CRMP4a and human CRMP4a (Figure 3.2).

\subsection{Western Blotting}
CRMP4 was visualized in western blot using a chemiluminescent substrate (cat. 34077, Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) after incubation with the same anti-CRMP4 primary antibody used in all immunohistochemical reactions for this study (1:2,500 dilution) and an HRP conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution, cat. 111-035-003, Jackson, West Grove, PA).  Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)  expression was used as a loading control and was visualized after incubation with an anti-GAPDH antibody(1:10,000 dilution, cat. MAB374, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and an HRP conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution, cat. 15-035-003, Jackson, West Grove, PA).

\subsection{Myelin staining}
Myelin expression was characterized using a modified Gallyas stain as described previously (Gallyas, 1979; Pistorio et al., 2006).  Briefly, tissue sections are fixed thoroughly before impregnation with ammoniacal silver nitrate and development in ammonium nitrate, silver nitrate, and tungstosilic acid.

\subsection{Image analysis}
All images were acquired and analyzed at a resolution of .995µm/pixel.  To quantify the immunhistochemical staining patterns observed in the ferret LGN, a custom MATLAB software package was employed.  Using this software, a contour was drawn at the medial boundary of the binocular LGN between the PGN and the LGN.  At every pixel along the drawn contour (pixel resolution = .995µm/pixel), lines spanning the  medial to lateral axis of the LGN were extended perpendicular to the drawn contour.  The middle 25 lines (blue overlay in figure 3.2a) were considered for further analysis, thus ensuring that only the center of the binocular region was used for CRMP4 characterization.  For the pixel resolution these analyses were carried out at, the central region of 25 lines corresponded to a region of interest 24.8µm wide across the anterior to posterior axis.  This width was chosen as a reasonable optimization between the noise reduction and laminar aliasing that occur by averaging in the anterior to posterior axis.  Laminar regions and interlaminar zones were manually identified in the average linescan and the summed expression for each was calculated.  In all slices where LGN layers could be clearly identified, the ratio of the interlaminar and laminar CRMP4 expression to background staining in the PGN was calculated.  For the data presented in this paper, four to seven sequential slices per LGN were quantified according to equation 3.1. 
\begin{equation}
Relative Fluorescence = \frac{Local Fluorescence}{PGN Fluorescence}*100
\end{equation}

Using this method, relative fluorescence was measured at the following locations: PGN-A interlaminar zone, A lamina, A-A1 interlaminar zone, A1 lamina, A1-C interlaminar zone, C laminae, as well as the within layer ON/OFF boundaries.  Measurements from the interlaminar zones and sublaminar boundaries (PGN-A border, A-A1 border, A1-C border, A and A1 within layer ON/OFF boundaries) were averaged and compared to the average measurements from the main LGN layers (A, A1, C layers)  Significant differences in staining between interlaminar zones and the main LGN layers were assessed by comparison of average relative fluorescence measurements (equation 1) using a paired t-test.  Additional characterization of the CRMP4 expression pattern was carried out by separating the within layer ON/OFF boundaries of the A and A1 lamina from the interlaminar zones.  In this analysis scheme, CRMP4 expression in the interlaminar zones (PGN-A border, A-A1 border, and A1-C border) and the within layer ON/OFF boundaries (A and A1 ON/OFF boundaries) were compared to main layer expression separately.

\section{Results}
In the ferret, there is no significant LGN CRMP4 staining during the first ten days of life (figure 3.1).Ê By P12, there is significant CRMP4 expression in the interlaminar zones between the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) and the LGN as well as at the boundaries between the A, A1, and C laminae.Ê Additionally, there is sparse labeling in LGN cell bodies.Ê This pattern is maintained throughout the next four weeks before tapering off and was not found after P45 (figure 3.1).Ê Western blot against CRMP4 supports this observation, revealing a stronger band of expression for CRMP4 at P35 than at P55 (figure 3.2). Quantification using a semi-automated algorithm confirmed this developmental expression profile of CRMP4 in the LGN.  CRMP4 expression in interlaminar zones is significantly higher than in the laminar zones from P12 to P45 (paired t-test, p<.05)(gray box, figure 3.2d).Ê In addition to the expression of CRMP4 in the interlaminar zones, there was weaker but significant (paired t-test, p<.05) staining for CRMP4 at the location of the within layer ON/OFF boundaries in both layer A and A1, which have been defined both anatomically and physiologically in the ferret previously (Linden et al., 1981a; Stryker and Zahs, 1983).  Staining at the within layer (A and A1) ON/OFF boundaries is significant in a more constrained developmental window (P25-45, figure 3.4) than in the interlaminar zones.  Thus, CRMP4 expression in the normally developing LGN appears to be specific to the interlaminar zones and the within layer ON/OFF boundaries.

In the developing ferret retina, CRMP4 expression is concurrent with the LGN expression profile described above.Ê Fibrous processes in the inner and outer plexiform layers are clearly visible along with a labeled subset of retinal ganglion cells (figure 3.5).Ê CRMP4 positive retinal ganglion cell axons can be visualized running across the fiber layer of the retina and into the optic nerve head.Ê This staining pattern was very clear in a P18 ferret and was still recognizable though not as robust at P40.

CRMP4 has been recently identified as a mediator of myelin dependent neurite outgrowth inhibition (Alabed et al ,2007; also see section 5.3.1).  In order to determine if this may be a pathway in which CRMP4 is participating in the ferret LGN, I stained the developing ferret LGN for myelin using a modified Gallyas stain.  There was a dense stain at the medial boundary of the nucleus as well as at the interlaminar zones in  P40 ferret LGN (figure 3.6).

\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Summary of findings}
This study describes the developmentally regulated spatiotemporal expression profile of CRMP4 in the ferret LGN.Ê Immunostaining against CRMP4 shows expression in the interlaminar zones of the LGN,Ê at the medial boundary of the LGN (between the LGN and the PGN), at the boundaries between the A, A1, and C laminae, and at the within layer ON/OFF boundaries.Ê CRMP4 expression at cytoarchitectonic boundary regions in the LGN is also observed in both the developing mouse and macaque LGN.Ê In an E143 macaque, there is expression of CRMP4 in the interlaminar zones reminiscent of our observations in ferret. Ê In the developing mouse, we found robust staining along the medial boundary of the nucleus in the external medullary lamina, but there is no interlaminar expression as is seen in the ferret and the macaque.

Expression of CRMP4 in LGN interlaminar zones is developmentally regulated.Ê Our immunohistochemical stains against CRMP4 reveal a developmental window between P12 and P45 in which the interlaminar zones of the LGN are marked by CRMP4.Ê This is supported by western blot analysis of P35 and P55 LGNs.Ê A third confirmation of the presence of CRMP4 in the ferret LGN from this developmental epoch comes from additional work performed in our lab.Ê CRMP4 has emerged as a laminar marker candidate in an unbiased proteomic screen for differential laminar expression during the final stages of LGN laminar development from P14-P25 (see chapter 2).  While this screen was targeted at the molecular characterization of the A and A1 LGN laminae, our finding of CRMP4 in this screen most likely the result of a small tissue sampling error.  Accidental and biased Inclusion of the interlaminar zones into one laminar sample but not the other could result in the identification of an interlaminar marker in this screen.

I also show that CRMP4 is expressed in a subset of retinal ganglion cells during the same developmental epoch in which CRMP4 expression is seen in the LGN.  It is likely that retinal ganglion cells are one of the major sources of interlaminar CRMP4 expression in the developing LGN.Ê

\subsection{Pitfalls and limitations}
The main shortcoming of this work is the difficulty with which specific expression of CRMP4 in retinogeniculate axons can be determined.  While it is clear that a subset of  retinal ganglion cells express CRMP4 in the developing retina, it is not clear if they are the only source of CRMP4 in the developing LGN.  I have attempted to use high resolution confocal imaging to co-localize cholera toxin $\beta$-subunit used as a retinogeniculate tracer (see 4.2 for specific methods) and CRMP4 expression with little definitive success.    My attempts at co-localization have been hindered by the fidelity of our chosen CRMP4 antibody at small spatial scales.  It is possible that the CRMP4 antibody used in these studies is less specific than we originally thought and that non-specificity only becomes apparent at high magnification.  Given that this antibody has not been robustly characterized in the ferret certainly leaves this possibility open.  Under high magnification, it is difficult to distinguish CRMP4 expression signal from background and as such it is difficult to localize CRMP4 expression to retinogeniculate  axons.  An additional limitation of this study is the relative unavailability of macaque LGN tissue when compared with the ferret.  I have robustly characterized the developmentally regulated expression of CRMP4 in the ferret and confirmed that the expression in the macaque LGN mirrors that of the ferret at a single developmentally matched time-point, but I was unable to explore CRMP4 expression in the macaque LGN throughout development.

\subsection{Discussion}
Expression of CRMP4 is seen in the interlaminar zones of both the ferret and the macaque during LGN development.  CRMP4 is expressed at the medial boundary of the mouse LGN, but there is no laminar expression in the nucleus itself.  The lack of laminar CRMP4 expression in the mouse LGN is consistent with CRMP4 as a marker protein for cytoarchitectonically defined boundaries in the nucleus.Ê The mouse LGN has robustly segregated inputs from the two retinas (Godement et al., 1984; Torborg and Feller, 2004), but it lacks the cell sparse zones that accompany eye-specific layers in higher mammals.Ê If CRMP4 delineates cytoarchitectonic boundary regions in the LGN, the presence of laminar CRMP4 expression in ferret and macaque but not in mouse is the expected result. 
CRMP family mediates axonal dynamics and in this role CRMP4 may help to delineate laminar boundaries through the reorganization of retinogeniculate processes at the cytoarchitectonic boundaries in the LGN where CRMP4 expression is high.Ê Assuming this mode of action, it would be expected that the major source of LGN CRMP4 expression is retinogeniculate axons.  CRMP4 expression is evident across the retina in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, lending support to this hypothesis.Ê

The timing of CRMP4 interlaminar zone expression in the ferret LGN is developmentally relevant because this is when the LGN develops mature morphology (Linden et al., 1981a).Ê The earliest expression of CRMP4 in the interlaminar zones is coincident with their initial formation.Ê Before the onset of CRMP4 expression in the ferret LGN, eye-specific segregation of retinal afferents is essentially complete, but cell sparse interlaminar zones have not formed (Linden et al., 1981a).Ê 

The segregation of eye-specific inputs in the LGN has been shown to be dependent on both neural activity and molecular cues (Sretavan and Shatz, 1986b; Huberman et al., 2002; Huberman et al., 2005).Ê Altering the expression of key proteins in the retina or the LGN leads to defects in retinothalamic projections, likely resulting from an aberrant molecular contribution to the balance between neural activity and gene expression (Huberman et al., 2005; Pfeiffenberger et al., 2005).Ê A growing list of molecular candidates capable of altering the retinogeniculate projection at different phases of development have emerged over the past decade.Ê These include the Zic family of zinc-finger transcription factors, which affect both the targeting of ipsilateral projections to the LGN and their elaboration once in the nucleus (Herrera et al., 2003; Horng et al., 2009), Ten-m3 which affects ipsilateral afferent targeting (Leamey et al., 2007), and the Ephrins and Eph receptors which mediate proper retinogeniculate targeting as well as topographic patterning (Flanagan and Vanderhaeghen, 1998; Frisen et al., 1998; Williams et al., 2003; Huberman et al., 2005; Pfeiffenberger et al., 2005).Ê I propose that CRMP4 may be acting after these paradigms have exerted their influence on the development of the LGN.Ê I hypothesize that CRMP4 may fine tune and/or reinforce the final aspects of LGN segregation and lamination.

The CRMP family of phosphoproteins are mediators of semaphorin induced growth cone collapse and dynamics (Goshima et al., 1995) as well as mediators of neurite formation and extension (Inagaki et al., 2001; Fukata et al., 2002).Ê As semaphorin is aÊdiffuse-able cue, it is unlikely that CRMP4 in the developing LGN is operating as a mediator of semaphorin signaling, because LGN CRMP4 expression is so spatially precise.Ê Secondary functions of the CRMP family have also been described. Ê CRMP2 has recently been shown to interact with the N-type presynaptic calcium channel CaV2.2, increasing their calcium current density (Brittain et al., 2009).Ê If CRMP4 acted similarly, local modulation of presynaptic calcium levels could influence the behavior of retinal afferents at interlaminar regions by altering neurotransmitter release.Ê However, this mechanism may not be consistent with neurite retraction from interlaminar zones.Ê CRMP4 has also recently been shown to interact with RhoA as a mediator of myelin dependent neurite outgrowth inhibition (Alabed et al., 2007b).Ê In humans and monkeys, the interlaminar zones of the LGN appear to be more heavily myelinated than the main layers of the LGN (Snider and Lee, 1961; Woolsey et al., 2003).  My data also shows that the ferret LGN is more heavily myelinated at the cell sparse interlaminar zones.  The formation of the interlaminar zones and concomitant increase in CRMP4 expression may reveal refinement of eye-specific projections through myelin dependent neurite outgrowth inhibition.

The spatiotemporal profile of retinogeniculate axon CRMP4 expression is consistent with a model in which CRMP4 helps to fine tune or reinforce laminar boundaries.Ê As the nucleus matures and begins to exhibit interlaminar zones, CRMP4 expression rises at these boundaries.Ê Once the nucleus has reached its adult form, CRMP4 expression fades.Ê Expression of CRMP4 in retinogeniculate axons could allow them to respond to increased myelination at the interlaminar zones, thus eliminating aberrant projections at LGN boundaries.  Immunostains in the developing mouse and macaque LGNs show that CRMP4 expression is also present in these species during late LGN development, suggesting a conserved developmental mechanism.  In the primate, the interlaminar zones of the LGN serve particular functions and are targeted by a specific class of retinal ganglion cells(Hendry and Yoshioka, 1994; Hendry and Reid, 2000).  Specific expression of CRMP4 in a subset of retinal ganglion cells may reflect the repulsion of some retinal ganglion cell classes (e.g. magnocellular and parvocellular), but not others (e.g. koniocellular).  As carnivores and rodents lack a koniocellular pathway, CRMP4 may promote more general refinement of retinal axons into appropriate LGN regions in these species.
